# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.

font-family = GeistMono Nerd Font

# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#

# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":

theme = catppuccin-frappe

# Background 

  background = "#000000"
  background-opacity = 0.8

# Remove Close Pop-up
confirm-close-surface = false

 keybind = ctrl+d=scroll_page_fractional:0.5
 keybind = ctrl+u=scroll_page_fractional:-0.5

# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms
